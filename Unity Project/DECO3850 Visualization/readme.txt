Hey Guys.

So currently there are four scenes (each one can be a different test visualisation) in the project.

To Switch between them you press 'A' for scene 1, 'B' for scene 2, 'C' for scene 3 and 'D' for scene 4.  It's not really intuitive but for some reason i coded that in. 

I've commented all the code so it should hopefully be understandable 


Scene Breakdown

Scene 1: 
	Currently just a cube that you can control with right and left arrow keys to move.

Scene 2: 
	With arrow keys you can rotate the cube right to left.  except that isn't working yet.  I'll do it soon.

Scene 3:
	Nothing but the coloured plane (the background).  Go wild with whatever you want to do.

Scene 4:
	Same as Scene 3.



I'll write up a tutorial on how to make a new scene with unity and fit it into the project soon, but if you really need a new one, just ask and I'll make it quickly.

I'm not a great coder so a bit of the implimentation is butts because it repeats some stuff.

Go wild with testing out different things in different scenes, but try to stick to one scene at a time, and post on github (i'll make an issue thing [Which is like a comment stream]) when you are doing it and which parts you're working on so that we don't overlap.  Also remember to commit AND pull often.

If you don't understand how github works (I don't fully), here are a couple of resources: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
